# DS18B20
Use DS18B20 temperature sensors with RPi.
This repo includes simple demo code.

The image below shows DS18B20 based temperature sensor wired into a CM4 IO Board. It also shows a BME280 (dfifferent project!).
Red and Black are power, seems to be fine with 5VDC or 3V3.
A 4.7kÎ© resistor bridges between Vcc and the yellow wires.
I have connected up to 6 of these to a RPi Zero without problems.
